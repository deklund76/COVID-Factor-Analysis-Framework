# Team members have drafted their project, including the following:
## ✓ Selected topic

Our topic of choice is COVID-19 data exploration.

## ✓ Reason why they selected their topic

We took a series of polls, and COVID-19 was the most voted for subject. In the final 3 topics it was voted by consensus. But, in all seriousness, COVID has been one of, if not the single, most significant events of the last year. It reshaped, not only American society, but most countries across the world.

## ✓ Description of their source of data

https://data.cdc.gov/ The CDC collects a lot of data, and organizes it into sets. Specifically the cases and deaths over time, and the vaccination rate over time are our starter sets.

## ✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data

We hope to create two machine learning models, one for cases and one for deaths specifically, with as high accuracy as possible. The primary question is: which data features produce the best accuracy for our target?
